# discord-server-copy
Copy content of a discord server into another server using self bot.





# NOTE:
Self bot means you don't need to add a real 'discord bot' to do the server copy. All you need is a normal common user account in both servers you'd like to copy from and copy to. But Self bot is forbidden by discord rules. Experimental use only and use at own risk.

This is a new project/also my first project using Javascript, so there will be potential bugs.

# How to get the user login token and channel/server id

For channel/server id, open dev mode and right click on channel/server name.

For login token, press ctrl+shift+i before login. And then.....(you can google the next steps)
