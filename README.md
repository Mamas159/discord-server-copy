# servercopy
Copy content of a server into another server. Useful when you have multiple 'burner dc' (cook groups/ bots)
and don't want to switch back and forth to see important annoucements.

Don't use to auto-leak message to another server although it's possible.




NOTE:Self bot is forbidden. Experimental use only and use at own risk

This is a new project/also my first project using Javascript, so there will be potential bugs.


See video for current function:
History message copy with autofetch:"https://youtu.be/DkWJkpA0jkQ"

Shopify Monitor content forward with autoforwarding: "https://youtu.be/zRL96s9gYyI"
It's not very useful for copying monitor message as there will be delays.
(even 1-2s delay can prevent you from copping shoes/clothes)
