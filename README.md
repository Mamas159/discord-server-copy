# servercopy
Copy content of a discord server into another server using self bot.Useful when you have multiple 'burner dc' (cook groups/ bots) and don't want to switch back and forth to see important annoucements.

Don't use this script to auto-leak message to another server although it's possible. For those groups which require you to pay for memberships, copying message and share to other people is not allowed.




NOTE:Self bot means you don't need to add a real 'discord bot' to the group to do the server copy. But Self bot is forbidden. Experimental use only and use at own risk

This is a new project/also my first project using Javascript, so there will be potential bugs.


See video for current function:
History message copy with autofetch:"https://youtu.be/DkWJkpA0jkQ"

Shopify Monitor content forward with autoforwarding: "https://youtu.be/zRL96s9gYyI"
It's not very useful for copying monitor message as there will be delays.
(even 1-2s delay can prevent you from copping shoes/clothes)
